Mission Metrics Management

This module provides functions to track and update mission progress metrics including
kill counts, capture progress, and capture capability. These
metrics represent the current tactical situation and progress toward mission objectives.

The metrics are updated each simulation step and used for reward calculation,
termination conditions, and agent observations.
